**Frostiful** is a Vanilla+ combat and survival temperature mod that substantially reworks the Powder Snow freezing mechanics. It introduces more ways of freezing and being frozen, as well as new methods for warming up again.

## Freezing

There are now many more ways to freeze to death in addition to powder snow with Frositful installed. Passive freezing, icicles, and new enchantments are some of the exciting new ways the game will turn you into a popsicle!

There are also new ways of resisting the cold! Use **Fur Tufts** to craft fur armor, which provides **Frost Resistance** to help you keep warm and resist the creeping winter. When you get too cold, warm up by the light of a fire or by getting some heat from a **Sun Lichen-covered rock**, or even steal the heat from your enemies with Enervation!

## Frostology and the Re-Branded Iceologer

**Frostology** is a new form of Illager magic that deals with all matters of cold and frost. **Frostologers** are a new take on the Iceologer from Minecraft Dungeons, and they the master of this magic. They reside in their snowy fortresses in the Snowy Plains biome, where they are surrounded by an army of **Chillagers** at their call. Chillagers wield Crossbows loaded with Frosty Arrows that are capable of long-distance freezing. Having mastered the magic of Frost, the Frostologer is not immune to freezing, but is instead strengthened by it. When they are cold, they gain tremendous power. However, that power is lost if they warm up again.

You can wield this magic, too. By defeating the Frostologer and relieving them of their **Frost Wand**, you can gain the ability to shoot balls of ice that freeze enemies in place when they are hit. If you can demonstrate your mastery over the Frost by keeping the Frostologer warm at death, it will additionally drop a **Cloak of Frostology**. The Cloak is an **obtainable cape** item that reverses the effects of freezing to make you become like the Frostologer yourself. Be careful though! With the Frostology Cloak on, you will begin to melt if you get too warm!

# Permissions

Frostiful is licensed under LGPLv3. You can use this mod in mod packs, YouTube videos, or anything else. However, I do ask that you do not redistribute it without my explicit permission and a link back to the original CurseForge, Modrinth, and GitHub pages.

# Configuration

Frostiful is extremely highly configurable. It has an extensive config that lets you play around with different settings, disable features, or tweak the values of various things to adjust the difficulty of the mod. For example, if you're not all that into survival or have another temperature mod like EnvironmentZ, but still wanna try out the Frost Wand, you can completely disable passive freezing! It also has a fair amount of datapack integration from tags, to the status effects from freezing, to the attributes of items! The wiki has all of the detail, so be sure to read that when delving into config for Frostiful: https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/frostiful/wiki/Config

Frostiful also exposes a number of vanilla mechanics related to freezing to configuration or datapacks, such as what boots can be used to walk on powder snow, how much and how often freeze damage applies when fully frozen, and the effects you get from being cold.

### Compatibility

While this mod is designed to be as compatible as possible with other mods, it is inevitable that sometimes issues will arise. Specific incompatibilities will be documented here and on the [wiki](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/frostiful/wiki#compatibility) as they become known.

* [PyroFrost](https://modrinth.com/mod/pyrofrost): No crash, but PyroFrost has a temperature system different from Frostiful/Thermoo, so you will have 2 temperature bars.

* [Thermite](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermite): Same as PyroFrost.

# Other Recommended Mods

These mods aren't made by me, but I think they're pretty neat and go well with Frostiful:

* [Snow! Real Magic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/snow-real-magic-fabric): Really helps the snowy ambience, and goes with icicles really well!
* [Creatures from the Snow](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/creatures-from-the-snow-fabric): Adds lots of really cute ambient creatures to snow biomes
* [Immersive Weathering](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersive-weathering): Adds some neat features that go along with Frostiful well. You may want to disable their icicles, though.
* [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets): If you just want to have the Cloak of Frostology as a cosmetic item, equip it in the Trinkets cape slot!
* [Disable Custom Worlds Advice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-disable-custom-worlds-advice): Disable the experimental settings warning (Frostiful uses such settings, and they are probably safe)
* [Dehydration](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dehydration): Adds a thirst bar, for when you're really into the survival thing.
